**The Cardputer** is a credit card-sized computer created by **M5Stack**, part of their M5 product line. It’s designed to be ultra-portable, low-power, and great for embedded systems or personal projects that need a compact computing platform. It typically functions as a mini-computer or development board, often used for programming, hacking, wireless communication (like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth), and IoT projects.
  
**Cardputer** v1.1 is a high-performance card computer designed for engineers, offering a comprehensive upgrade over the original Cardputer. The new version features the brand new StampS3A main controller, with optimized antenna and button design for the core module, significantly enhancing system stability and user experience. In terms of control interaction, the product is equipped with a 56-key keyboard and a 1.14-inch TFT screen for efficient display and operation; it includes an onboard SPM1423 digital MEMS microphone supporting recording and wake-up functions, and outputs audio through a cavity speaker. Additionally, an infrared emitter provides external infrared control interaction capabilities. For expansion, the built-in Grove interface facilitates custom sensor expansion; for storage, a Micro SD card slot is available for easy storage expansion. The power system uses an internal 120mAh and a base 1400mAh lithium battery power solution, integrating lithium battery charging and boost-buck circuits, greatly enhancing battery life. Structurally, the base includes magnets for metal attachment and is compatible with LEGO hole expansion. This product is widely applicable in various scenarios such as rapid function verification for engineers, industrial control, and home control systems.
